In this program, you will be re-create a Wordle game. You are given two classes: WordleGame.java and Main.java. You will be modifying these two classes, and creating a third one. You are also given a text file database.txt, which is a list of 5-letter words (all 5-letter words from the first Harry Potter book!). The objective of your program is to create a Wordle game with a random word from the text file.

Requirements:

1.Modify the Main.java to read a word from the database.txt file

2.Create a custom exception named InvalidInputException that will be used when the user inputs an invalid guess (invalid doesn't mean wrong, means it's not 5-letter long, etc.)

3.Throw the exception from the WordleGame class when appropriate

4.Use try/catch in the Main when appropriate
